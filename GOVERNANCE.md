# LFortran Governance

## Technical Decisions

Technical decisions are made by the developer community by discussing at each
Merge Request (MR) and arriving at a consensus. In case of disagreements, the
project leader (Ondřej Čertík) will facilitate the discussion and help achieve a
consensus. If a consensus cannot be achieved, the final decision will be made by
the project leader.

## Financial Decisions

Financial decisions are made by Ondřej Čertík and Milan Curcic with the goal to
benefit and be good stewards of the LFortran community.
