## Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone, even if you are new to open source. It
might sound daunting to contribute to a compiler at first, but please do, it is
not complicated. We will help you with any technical issues and help improve
your contribution so that it can be merged.

To contribute, submit a Merge Request (MR) against our repository at:

https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran

If you have any questions or need help, please ask as at our
[mailinglist](https://groups.io/g/lfortran) or a
[chat](https://lfortran.zulipchat.com/).

Please note that all participants of this project are expected to follow our
Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its
terms. See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

By submitting an MR you agree to license your contribution under
the LFortran's BSD [license](LICENSE) unless explicitly noted otherwise.
