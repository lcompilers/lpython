# Installation

Follow the steps below to install and run LPython on Linux, Windows or macOS.

## Prerequisites
### Install Conda
Follow the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/#download) to install Conda on your platform (Linux, macOS and Windows) using a conda-forge distribution called Miniforge.

For Windows, these are the additional requirements:
- Miniforge Prompt
- Visual Studio (with "Desktop Development with C++" workload)

### Set up your system
#### Linux
Run the following command to install some global build dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential binutils-dev clang zlib1g-dev
```
#### Windows
- Download and install [Microsoft Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) for free.

- Run the Visual Studio Installer. Download and install the "Desktop Development with C++" workload which will install the Visual C++ Compiler (MSVC).

- Launch the Miniforge prompt from the Desktop. It is recommended to use MiniForge instead of Powershell as the main terminal to build and write code for LPython. In the MiniForge Prompt, initialize the MSVC compiler using the below command:

    ```bash
    call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd" -arch=x64
    ```

    You can optionally test MSVC via:

    ```bash
    cl /?
    link /?
    ```

    Both commands must print several pages of help text.

#### Windows with WSL
- Install Miniforge Prompt and add it to path:
    ```bash
    wget  https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
    bash miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/conda_root
    export PATH="$HOME/conda_root/bin:$PATH"
    conda init bash # (shell name)
    ```
- Open a new terminal window and run the following commands to install dependencies:
    ```bash
    conda create -n lp -c conda-forge llvmdev=11.0.1 bison=3.4 re2c python cmake make toml clangdev git
    ```

- Optionally, you can change the directory to a Windows location using `cd /mnt/[drive letter]/[windows location]`. For e.g. - `cd mnt/c/Users/name/source/repos/`.

    
### Clone the LPython repository
Make sure you have `git` installed. Type the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lcompilers/lpython.git
cd lpython
```

You may also use GitHub Desktop to do the same.

## Building LPython
### Linux and macOS
- Create a Conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment_unix.yml
    conda activate lp
    ```

- Generate the prerequisite files and build in Debug Mode:

    ```bash
    # If you are developing on top of a forked repository, please run following command first - ./generate_default_tag.sh


    ./build0.sh
    ./build1.sh
    ```

### Windows
- Create a Conda environment using the pre-existing file:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment_win.yml
    conda activate lp
    ```

- Generate the prerequisite files and build in Release Mode:

    ```bash
    call build0.bat
    call build1.bat
    ```
### Windows with WSL

- Activate the Conda environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate lp
    ```

- Run the following commands to build the project:
    ```bash
    ./build0.sh
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_LLVM=yes -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pwd`/inst .\
    make -j8
    ```

## Testing
The LPython codebase broadly contains 3 types of tests: 
1. **Integration tests:** Check whether the code compiles correctly and gives the required output at runtime.
2. **Compile time tests:** Check whether the code compiles correctly and generates the required compile time values for compile time evaluations.
3. **Error tests:** Check whether the code compiles correctly and throws the required error for invalid operations.

Follow the instructions provided below to understand the method of writing and running tests.

### Writing tests
Of the 3 types stated above, not all are always required to be written together. Follow the steps provided below to understand how each test is written:

#### Integration tests
The integration tests are located inside `./integration_tests`. To write an integration test, follow the steps provided below:
1. **Write tests:** Check whether the test file already exists. This will almost always be the case when you want to include tests for new additions to a module, built-in functions or data-type attributes. Just add a new function which tests for the changes you made. Add a function call for your function at the required position.

If the file does not exist, create one and follow the steps stated above.

2. **Update test references:** After you are done writing your tests, update the test references through the following script.
    ```bash
    ./run_tests.py -u
    ```

#### Compile time tests
TODO: Learn more

#### Error tests
The error tests are located inside `./tests/errors/`. You are required to write an error test for every such action for which your code intentionally raises an error. For example, if your code raises a ZeroDivisionError, you need to write an error test for that. An error test is simply a piece of code which causes the required error to be raised.

The procedure of writing an error test is the same as integration tests. One also needs to update the test references for the same.
    
### Running tests
#### Linux and macOS
- Run ctest:

    ```bash
    ctest
    ./run_tests.py
    ```
- Run integration tests:

    ```bash
    cd integration_tests
    ./run_tests.py
    ```
> [!NOTE]
> In case you have recently updated macOS, you may get a warning like below in some test cases:
> 
> ```bash
> ld: warning: object file (test_list_index2.out.tmp.o) was built for newer macOS version (14.0) than being linked (13.3)
> ```
> This leads to mismatch of hashes with expected output in some test cases, this can be resolved by updating command line tools:
>
> ```bash
> git clean -dfx
> sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools # make sure you know what you're doing here
> sudo xcode-select --install
> ./build.sh
> ./run_tests.py
> ```

> [!TIP]
> Integration tests run slowly on macOS because Apple checks the hash of each executable online before running.
> 
> You can turn off that feature in the Privacy tab of the Security and Privacy item of `System Preferences > Developer Tools > Terminal.app > "Allow the apps below to run software locally that does not meet the system's security policy."`


#### Windows
- Run integration tests

    ```bash
    python run_tests.py --skip-run-with-dbg
    ```

- Update reference tests

    ```bash
    python run_tests.py -u --skip-run-with-dbg
    ```

## Examples (Linux and macOS)

You can run the following examples manually in a terminal:

```bash
./src/bin/lpython examples/expr2.py
./src/bin/lpython examples/expr2.py -o expr
./expr
./src/bin/lpython --show-ast examples/expr2.py
./src/bin/lpython --show-asr examples/expr2.py
./src/bin/lpython --show-cpp examples/expr2.py
./src/bin/lpython --show-llvm examples/expr2.py
./src/bin/lpython --show-c examples/expr2.py
```

## Enabling the Jupyter Kernel

To install the Jupyter kernel, install the following Conda packages also:
```
conda install xeus=5.1.0 xeus-zmq=3.0.0 nlohmann_json
```
and enable the kernel by `-DWITH_XEUS=yes` and install into `$CONDA_PREFIX`. For
example:
```
cmake . -GNinja \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DWITH_LLVM=yes \
    -DWITH_XEUS=yes \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$CONDA_PREFIX" \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$CONDA_PREFIX"
    .
ninja install
```
To use it, install Jupyter (`conda install jupyter`) and test that the LPython
kernel was found:
```
jupyter kernelspec list --json
```
Then launch a Jupyter notebook as follows:
```
jupyter notebook
```
Click `New->LPython`. To launch a terminal jupyter LPython console:
```
jupyter console --kernel=lpython
```
